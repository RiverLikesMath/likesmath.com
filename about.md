PROFILE CARD

Ever since I was a kid, math has made me happy. And, in college, I started tutoring to pay for books. I enjoyed it, I was good at it, but I thought I was going to get my Ph.D in math and study equations for the rest of my life. 

Then, right before I graduated, I joined a program that put me in a classroom. In that job, I taught kids one on one and in small groups. I worked there 8 hours a day, every day, for a full school year. That’s when I realized that not only do I enjoy teaching, I have a real passion for it. I knew, in my gut, that every single one of those kids deserved an excellent education. I was utterly determined to give it to them. I want them to enjoy math as much as I do.

That job lit a fire in me. I spent every day at that school honing my craft. After that, I never stopped. For almost ten years afterwards, I’ve brought that same fire and that same desire to improve.Day after day, I learn why kids fail, how to motivate them, how to impart problem solving skills and then give them confidence in those skills. And, for fun, I teach my roommates how to do calculus.
