PROFILE CARD
 
For a list of subjects I tutor, click [here](subjects.html). The short version? If it's math, I can do it. Any age, any subject. I've succesfully taught math at the graduate level, to pre-kindergarteners, and everybody in between. When it comes to other subjects, check the list! There's a good chance I've got you covered. 

Ever since I was a kid, I've loved math. In college, while I was getting my degree in it, I started tutoring to pay for books. I enjoyed tutoring, I was good at it, but I thought I was going to get my Ph.D in math and study equations for the rest of my life. 

Then, right before I graduated, I joined a program that put me full time in a classroom.  That’s when I realized that not only do I enjoy education, I'm passionate about it.  I was utterly determined to give every single one of those kids deserved an excellent education. 

I spent every day at that school honing my craft.  For almost ten years afterwards, I’ve brought that same fire and that same desire to improve. Day after day, I learn why kids fail, how to motivate them, how to impart problem solving skills and then give them confidence in those skills.  I never ever stop improving.  And, for fun, I teach my friends how to do calculus.
