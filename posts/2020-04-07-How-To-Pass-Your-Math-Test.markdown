title: How to Pass your (Math) Test
---

So, it's the day before the test. You've done the best you can to prepare up till now. What do you do? 

A big part of my job is helping students prepare for tests. I get approximately half of my new students that way! So I've had a lot of practice giving day-before-the-test advice. Here's what I tell my students:  

**The day before the test**

  * Study, study, study. 
  * Eat a good, healthy dinner. 
* Spend at least 20 minutes relaxing sometime the night before. 
* Get enough sleep! Get to bed as early as you realistically can.

**The morning of:** 

* Eat a good, healthy breakfast. 
* Drink enough water and use the restroom before you get to class. Take care of yourself physically and minimize possible distractions. Wear warm clothes if you need to. 
* Get to class nice and early to ask questions and settle in. 
* Make sure you understand the format of the test, whether you’re allowed to use a calculator, anything peculiar about how it works, etc. This is especially important on standardized tests like the SAT, which have strange grading systems. 

**During the test:**
 
* Stay as physically relaxed as you can. Students often tense their shoulders when testing, let them be loose. 
* You’ll usually want to read the whole test first, to see what’s on it. 
* Pick the easiest questions and do them first. 
* Manage your time! If something’s taking too long, come back to it later. 
* Read instructions carefully. In word problems, read the prompting question carefully.
* Show your work! Showing your thinking and reading the questions carefully can help your grade significantly. 
* Check your work when you’re done. If you’re really not sure whether or not to change an answer, leave it. 

Good luck, and have fun on your next test!
